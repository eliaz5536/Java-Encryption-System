# Encryption System
# Naive RSA & Goldwesser Micali

This project focuses on building on encryption algorithms for plaintext, using Naive RSA & Goldwesser Micali, incorporating the use of BigInteger.
Furthermore, It demonstrates the insecurity of IND-CCA and IND-CPA from both encryption algorithms.
